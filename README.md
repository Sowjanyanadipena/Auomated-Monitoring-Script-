# Automated System Monitoring Script in Google Colab
## Overview
This project demonstrates an automated system monitoring script using Python in Google Colab. The script collects CPU and memory usage metrics and visualizes them using Matplotlib. It is useful for understanding basic system monitoring concepts and automation for engineering support roles.
## Features
- Collect CPU and memory usage data using psutil
- Log data over time in real-time
- Visualize usage trends with Matplotlib
- Runs easily on Google Colab with no extra setup
## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- psutil
- Matplotlib
## How to Run
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the system_monitoring.ipynb notebook or copy code below.
3. Run all cells to:
   - Install psutil (if not pre-installed)
   - Collect CPU and memory metrics
   - Plot usage trends
4. (Optional) Modify intervals and thresholds to simulate alerts.
